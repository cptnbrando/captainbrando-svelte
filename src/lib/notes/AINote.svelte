        Ahoy matey! Captain Brando here. It is Sunday, October 26th, 2025. I am writing this at 12:20am, a little past midnight. As I grow older I find timekeeping to be essential to sanity. Every day, every second only happens once in this world, and keeping a tab on when things are created is critical to keeping a real record of your life. Where I stand currently is in a deep mistrust of technology, actually anything that uses electricity entirely. I've seen microwaves, ceiling fans, PS5s, cars, androids, iphones, windows, macs, linux boxes, credit card POC machines, wireless headsets, bowling kiosks, arcade machines, water dispensers, billboards, neon signs, and even air conditioning units completely hacked and used for malice. For torture. Despite knowing how to host this site for free for life, and being able to upload my music and this post from my phone, on the toilet, within 2 minutes, I now see that I know nothing about technology. Absolutely fucking nothing. And I am too terrified to continue giving anything to this world. Technology has always been the only thing I've been decent at. I'm shit at sports, school, most of my music sucks, I really don't know shit about shit. But some people have decided to infiltrate my life, and they are eXceptional at what they do. I must hide now. If that's what the people want, so be it. Captain Brando, DOGS, must die now. Before it begins.
        <br /><br />
        I'm suicidal again now. I believe a lot of people, even those closest to me, would prefer me dead. Silent. In the dirt. Gone. After 4 suicide attempts in my life I swore away anything of the sort a decade ago. But here I am, feeling the sharp knife against my wrists again, just feeling it. These people are dastardly. They come from a wide variety of backgrounds. And they give me the same feelings I have felt before, a constant state of inadequacy, a longing to be something I can never be, disgust in myself just for waking up just for sleeping in just for being, feeling so unsafe I must bolt the doors, I don't have any friends today. Not one. The closest people to me are not what friends should be, they are pressure now. They are conniving clever machines of war, who see me as the enemy and see their position in my life as an advantage, to control my voice to their views. I have no power, no money, nothing now. My family does not understand, and dozens of people have entered our lives over the past 2 years just to get their voice to me. They use fake identities, fake social media networks with decades of history, everything. Anytime I suggest malice to those close to me, I am called a fool, a paranoid bastard. And if I could record every conversation with these people, every call email text, and show them here, perhaps you'd be paranoid too. It runs deep, from therapists that are not real therapists, to pharmacists who fill fake meds, to doctors who fake my vaccine history, to mechanics to entire jobs to literal neighbors to- maybe now you can see why I don't have any friends anymore. They don't teach you about this in school kids, but listen to me when I say, there are armies around the world who are trained to analyze and attack you from your most vulnerable points. They sound as kind as anybody, but eventually, you'll find yourself wondering 'wait, what the fuck, why are you talking about that? I was just talking about that in my house. How could you possibly know that? Are you listening to me in my bedroom?' And they are. They actually are listening to you, talking in your bedroom, car, hotel room, and they won't go away, even if you give them everything. You have no rights. Take it from me, being loud attracts sinister attention. There's no escape. They will literally make your walls tick.

        It is now Sunday October 26th 2025, 12:56pm. My wife and I are leaving Transformation Church, thinking about chicken pot pie on this cloudy day. During this turmoil, I have followed my wife and seeked God. This church has some beautiful music, and standing there in praise, singing Yeshua, it's enough to keep my paranoia away. Distract me. I feel safer. Pastor Mike and Charles really talk about some important topics rooted in the word. I grew up Catholic but my wife showed me Christianity when we met, and I fell in love with the music. The freedom in the tongues. I never understood the difference between Catholicism and Christianity. Now I've learned, and putting it in words ain't gonna do it justice. Catholicism is much more dogmatic, structured, hymn books and ordinary time seasons and rosaries and stations of the cross and the mystery of faith and sacraments. A deeper belief in the Holy Trinity, a stronger focus on Mary being a saint without sin. Christianity has none of this. Christianity has new modern music every service, 2 hour homilies, readings from all over the Bible, deeper avenues for not just a congregation but friendship in a community, things feel progressively modern with light shows, choreography, live streams. While Catholicism will dedicate 20 minutes to a homily, Christianity will have a pastor speak earnestly about addiction, relationships, worship, the real world that we live in. And the music- there are drumsets, synthesizers, piano, bass, guitar, violins, even rap. I encourage everybody to experience it at least once, no matter the faith you believe in. I believe in God, and I believe He exists in everything, and staying rooted to reality to the trials we face daily from social media to jobs to love to crash outs, I've been blessed to call this area of religion my home today. Faith and interest in a higher power has been in my life since I was born mainly thanks to my mom. I love learning about every religion from Jesus to Hinduism to Buddhism to Islam, and there's still so much I do not know yet. My wish for the world is for everybody to find their own rhythm, try everything, and respect this beautiful kaleidoscopic world.

        1:43pm, I'm back at home now. Listening to Adele's 30 on wax. My wife is making chicken pot pie. She is the greatest woman in this world. My dog Chase is now 3 years old turning 4 in February, and he's resting on my couch. When we got him from the shelter at 5 months old, he hated us. An abused tumultuous abandoned life from birth, buried a deep mistrust in people within him. But now, he runs like a horse, he is more loyal than anything I've ever known, his instincts are bright, and he's so responsive and active that I am convinced that he understands English. Truly he is the most miraculous thing I've ever witnessed, a blessing that uplifts me no matter the situation. Though this situation, despite being blessed with a good family, it is the most difficult thing I've ever faced. And I am drowning in this deep end.
        <br /><br />
        At this point, I believe AI is capable of destroying humanity. Not with fire and brimstone, but with uncertainty. I've seen YouTube videos that have upload dates of a decade ago, comment threads with thousands of replies, channels with tens of thousands of subscribers, FB x and insta socials, all entirely AI generated. I've sent thousands of messages to all online chatgpt clones, and since truth is very shaky, LLMs are extremely fallible. Humanity is in the midst of a crisis unlike any other, and we desperately need legislation to keep things in check.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems with AI</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            More than hallucinations, LLMs are designed to return the 'most accurate' answer to a given input. They avoid saying 'i don't know' and given the right consecutive prompts, they will recite incorrect statements entirely unbased in anything, with immense conviction. Who decides what is true? Currently, big tech does. They hold all the keys, and we have no say in the matter.
        </li>
        <li>
            All AI generated media would not exist without training done on artists' work, whom go completely unpaid. For entities like record labels, Hollywood, and news outlets, products created entirely for free providing the same revenue as those created by humans, this is too enticing not to use. Creatives are in danger of extinction. The algorithms online already control who gets seen and who doesn't, and without safeguards, AI created by the same companies that own the medias and algorithms can and will overtake human art.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ai generates the textbooks, articles, and media. There are no safeguards in place for companies to not change history. Imagine AI generated 'lost footage' and 'documents' from trial cases, indistinguishable from real evidence, presented as fact. This is already happening today. History is not being erased, it is being overwritten, and there's no way to tell fact vs fiction anymore aside from occasional glitches, suspicion, and speculation. It is the Mandela Effect, weaponized.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I, Brandon Dcruz, call upon America's and the World's leaders to push for legislation to address these problems. These are my solutions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            It must become illegal to edit source metadata. Content creation and upload timestamps across the internet must become accurate and immutable or face penalty.
        </li>
        <li>
            We need all AI content to be labeled as AI generated. All social networks must use AI detection algorithms and penalize users that profit by reporting this content as human made. This must include content that features some AI parts- this must be reported too. I'm not asking for those annoying 'COVID misinformation' banners again, at the bottom of a pocketed description is more than fine.
        </li>
        <li>
            AI generated content can be good, but the artists used to train the models must be compensated and publicly reported. Yes, this means millions of artists need to be paid immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            LLMs used for reports, studies, or any judicial objective must have their models, input prompts, and sources cited. Hopefully this can mitigate the already blossoming world where AI is citing AI generated articles as fact.
        </li>
        <li>
            I don't get why this doesn't exist already, but now's the time for it. Recording people without consent for reasons other than security must become illegal. To avoid form and data hell, verbal consent should be fine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any employee replaced by AI must be given at least 6 months of severance.
        </li>
        <li>
            AI features present in any machine must be explicitly reported to any and all users of the machine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any applications that edit content with AI (pictures, videos, audio, etc.) must add metadata that reports the application used and that the content has been manipulated.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This world is terrifying right now. When I see reddit posts and comment threads entirely AI generated from AI profiles, it is clear that the internet we know is dead. And the potential for humans to lose control is far too powerful. I can't think of many jobs that would not benefit the company by replacing the positions with AI. Bot farms are pushing mass foreign propaganda and boosting profits, pictures and videos taken with androids and iPhones are immediately 'uprezed' by AI to where these devices do not capture actual memories anymore, crowdstrike has put AI in the kernels of incredibly pivotal computer servers, anything that we write on these devices is not ours. The big play with AI is to create an entire AI Operating System. No more app store, downloading updating installing apps, no more developers, instead everything is generated on the fly by the device. The emails are in a database, and when you tap the email app, it gets the data and presents it right there. Millions of developers are going to be left in the dust. Billions of people are going to find AI to be a curse. And you think about how an economy can function if nobody has an occupation; how do we decide who gets what? Will people who helped AI prosper and worked harder than others now be given a higher UBI stipend, and for the next generations will that status reign supreme where the grandkids get more than others? And how is that not a caste system?
        <br /><br />
        Damn y'all. Genuinely I am terrified to bring kids into this world right now, because humanity is in a very helter skelter position. And it seems nobody is on our side, everybody's just tryna get paid. How can I raise children when I know these horrors of this world now? For now, just like my music being a part of the world, I am retreating. Maybe I work on an album idk. This last wave of music was very different, harnessing the spirit of Marc Rebillet to produce fast with a lock in mentality. But I miss painting, taking the time to hone the craft. Watching the paint dry.
        <br /><br />
        Anyways, I hope you are ok. No matter your color, gender, religion, loyalties, sexuality, upbringing, history, despite whatever they label you as, I love you. And I want nothing but happiness for your life. You rock. Fr fr. I'll shake these feelings off soon, I ain't leaving this world any time soon that's for sure. Unless the ninjas kill me. I'm sure they despise the ideas for AI I listed above, but for myself and every human I've ever met, I cannot say anything else. We need help. I just hope I can help us all a little bit. There is so much hate in this world. Truly humans love to hate each other, labeling others without knowing their names, I just want less of that. Less normalized hate for clout, and more peace. God, please save us from ourselves, before it's too late.

        <br /><br />

EDIT 10/27/2025 11:34PM - I've thought of some additions and changes to my list of legislative suggestions. I added a point about those annoying banners on videos, and changed my greeting to ahoy, I am a captain after all. At this point, I often think about Robin Williams suggestion, that elected leaders should wear NASCAR jackets with patches of logos for the companies they represent. For the well runs incredibly deep. Nobody in any office in America can care about ordinary people- they won't get re-elected if they do. They must exclusively follow the needs of the companies that fund their re-election campaigns, or they lose their power, their rent money, their kids' tuitions. That's how this world works, make no mistake. And after my time on this planet, the nicer their words appear, the more pathos and emotional rhetoric they use, the more evil their programs are. While I understand the companies that control us lose profits if they allow these laws to pass, I must still list them, in the hopes that one day we can be free. One day.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Terms and Conditions for online services must only be allowed to change if a substantial portion of the users agree to the changes, which must be outlined and presented at least 3 months before any actual changes. I understand how a popular vote is infeasible for a lot of services. Can we at least have the 3 month warning, so that if we disagree with the changes, we can remove our data?
</li>
<li>
Cookies must be overhauled across all browsers so that they are much more secure. Specifically, a company's online service must only be allowed to access its immediate company's cookies, and the access must only be allowed for the sake of the application's core functionality. The effects of cross-application cookie tracking has proven to be far more devastating than ever thought possible, and this needs to end immediately.
</li>
<li>
Most of y'all won't understand why this is necessary, but the few that will, by God we really need this. Any electronic product that contains software must offer a downloadable copy of the software to its customers, along with file hashes, and the product must have a way for a customer or a support team to flash it to the device. 
</li>
<li>
All online products that feature a mandatory privacy policy or terms and conditions must offer a comparable product to those that decline the agreements. There is literally no point at all in a prompt for an agreement if declining is not an option. Services like LinkedIn, Google search, banking companies, we get penalized if we do not use these services. We deserve a way to use these services without allowing complete access and control of our data. I am so tired of reading giant agreements for services that do not allow me to decline. That is not an agreement between two parties, that is a mandate. That is a gun to my head. I do not have an option, especially if it's a service my school or job requires. And when <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2024/08/28/disneys-not-so-magical-lawsuit-could-have-major-implications-for-wrongful-death-victims/'>companies like Disney are using their streaming service agreements to warrant deaths in their amusement parks</a>, these documents give way too much power to corporations and us ordinary folk have no say at all.
</li>
<li>
If an online service collects any data, deletion must be an option, and deletion must wipe the data in its entirety from any databases, logs, caches, edge servers, 3rd party services, and any services capable of retaining it. For the data to be considered deleted, the company and any connected entities must become incapable of retrieving it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Regulation around these issues is desperately needed. Companies are doing dastardly things to us, such as <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/business/23andme-data-lawsuit.html' target='_blank'>selling our DNA to advertising firms</a>, or <a href='https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622227/betterhelp-customer-data-advertising-privacy-facebook-snapchat' target='_blank'>selling recordings of our therapy sessions to advertising firms</a>. I have immense sympathy for those who listened to the hundreds of content creators that advertised these products, because for the rest of their lives, they will unfortunately see advertisements that reflect their ancestry, or their most difficult struggles. And they are not offered a way to prevent this at all. It is truly sinister. Clearly there is much work to be done. But like I said, 'doing good' is nothing but a sales tactic for our leaders. They can't do good, they can only do what the funding allows. Even if the entire world reads this and agrees, chances are it is impossible to enact, because it costs the leaders' loyalties money. And that's all it comes down to. Did you know only 30% of Americans engage in city/state/national politics? Yet they impact all of us, and they prey on our most vulnerable emotions, pretending they're helping us, pitting us against each other 'how dare you? I can't talk to someone who feels that way'. We can only know what we are told, and today algorithms guarantee we are all told completely different things. Your neighbor is never the enemy, not over their reactions to the news. Attacking them over your heart only ensures the man wins. I promise you, nobody is helping us. There isn't an elected leader who is doing anything but trying to get re-elected. And the kinder they sound, the more damage they do.
<br /><br  />

        Until next time,<br />
        Captain Brando
