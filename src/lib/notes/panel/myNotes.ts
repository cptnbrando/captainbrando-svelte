I saw this very inspirational message and wanted to tell y'all about how life's been lately. please let $&$v@# read this message, and show her the video after too.<br />
<br />
Since getting back to America, my company was on fire. They signed deals with Toyota, StubHub, the NBA, and so many other big companies. They specialized in 401ks, death certificates, loan repayments. Lots of fucking bullshit (data analytical perspective). And I was partnered with the guy in charge of a highway of data, a microservice architecture, Angular (js framework that specializes in generating massive amounts of fucking files for basic tasks to ensure that when 74 monkeys work on an Angular project, 1 monkey can't fuck it all up by themselves, usually).<br />
<br />
Big name companies lately have a lot of information to give, and a lot of money. Millions of dollars in one plan, billions of dollars in another plan (plans btw were like sets of companies, or just one company, either way, usually contain data for thousands of human beans, each labeled everywhere by their SSN, like prison numbers :), each day hundreds of business people writing spreadsheets and numbers (salaries, startDate, endDate, bullShit, bigShit, littleShit, fuckedShit, SSN, birthday, address, number, SSN again because devs love data, etc.). People pay credit cards through their phones now, and they need it reflected in their world instantly. Things are very, very fast. And data, just text, just words, like this story you are reading, is really fucking big.<br />
<br />
For 2 years I worked through cogs, a contracting company, for *@o&#^ Financial, I had a 3 month contract, then another 3 month contract, then a 6 month contract, then another 6, then another 6. *$^&y$ paid every contract, because my code was one of the only things somehow not breaking from the massive fucking data moving through it.<br />
<br />
One night I woke up at 3am to a text from a man I'd never met, saying he just updated the hours fix code. I made the hours fix code, and I was damn sure it was solid, because everything I've ever done for the company, it never failed. Not once. So I got online in my underwear, exhausted, to find that his fix did nothing related to my fix. He lied, worse off, other people believed it was my fault, because of a stupid man who's name I forget. Honestly, it's so complicated I don't even know what happened with it, but tests using a reverted commit with just my bullshit show it working just fine.<br />
<br />
I had a meeting the following morning with the man's team, a bunch of Indians from overseas, along with my team, 2 white guys but mostly also just a bunch of Indians from overseas (not being rude or crass, just blunt. I'm tired... sorry lol). <br />
<br />
I showed him his code, I showed him they're relentless updates, I showed them a massive, massive potential problem, possibly responsible for voya having to pay millions of dollars. And then they laughed in my face, and disconnected to hop to another meeting. My own team included, friends that I depended on frequestly, for 2 years.<br />
<br />
I kept digging, and I kept finding more and more bullshit. Actually no, I found something worse. Horseshit. Giant horseshit, everywhere. Code, shit. People, shit. Friends, cowards. Questions, everybody say "we don't know".<br />
<br />
I kept my shit remarks to myself, kept it professional, but I don't do great in stressful situations sometimes. And this being my first big job, I thought trying to stop a site that's literally bleeding millions every day would be helpful, no matter what I said. Evidently, that's not how the corporate world works. Endless days, 20 half hour meetings every day for months, everybody burnt out, everybody confused, and the tickets coming to my team were only getting incredibly (laughably) fucking worse. Thousands of incident tickets, millions of dollars, thousands of human beans not getting paid on time. Hundreds of managers entering in their data one-at-a-time, using a garbage incredibly slow piece of hot flaming ass flaps, a website, a system that loads whenever you click anything. <br />
<br />
I wrote a big report, detailing the potential problem and how the issue is probably why hundreds of tickets were opened and remained incomplete, even more that were closed with bullshit answers, sometimes even blaming completely innocent slaves OOPs I meant hundreds of co-working developers getting paid 45k a year, most working from overseas, remote desktop, doing everything their told. Working weekends, days, months, nights, weeks. Time moves strange sometimes, tunnel vision and shit. <br />
<br />
Despite the bullshit, business was booming incredibly well. What really happened behind the scenes is that the people in charge decided to hire the cheapest devs they could find, college grads, to make code. They actually cheaped out on everything, specifically, the giant water tank holding all of the data. Secretly, unbenownst to the 500 slaves OOPs I meant developers engaged in this project, the tank was fucking exploding. No one was smart enough, or educated enough, to even understand how or why it was exploding, they could barely see it. They asked me how i knew, if i googled it. I told them "No, ive seen this issue before, because i make a lot of mistakes, and i learn very quickly that way"<br />
<br />
A COBOL charged Masterfile, a text file, cannot be written to simultaneously. When a write request comes in, it locks the masterfile, stopping others from reading or writing to it until it's free. When thousands of things go to it at once, it spikes. You connected a microservice architecture to a toilet, a textfile. Then put it in prod, and lost millions.<br />
<br />
I sent that report, and the group chats everywhere died the following day. I was right.<br />
<br />
Business understood my vernacular. I dumbed it down, as the business manager had requested me to.<br />
<br />
I kept getting things right. Since the fire had relaxed with business now knowing their data input cannot overlap until that shit gets proper fixed, it was quiet for a weekend. Then a week, or two. My notes went all the way to the architects of the app suite, the big wigs, the head honchos, the scumbag motherfuckers at the top of this rickety corporate ladder. And they all realized I was completely (mostly) right.<br />
<br />
But that meant that they had all been wrong, for 4 years. Not just the 2 I had been there for. That means for 4 years, they lost millions, maybe billions, not including the salaries for 500 developers who couldnt solve it. And I told them how to stop doing that. Gave them a design doc for a new app to fix their shitshow.<br />
<br />
A new guy showed up to work the next day. His name is Patrick. His hair is red. The only thing I heard him say was "uhhhh... Ummm.. I don't know".<br />
<br />
Then they fired me. Let me go. Replaced me with a ginger.<br />
<br />
I cried about this for a while, but I worked (fun to go to a meeting labeled as "one-on-one catchup" while coding on a quick change code fix, only to get blindsided with a ban hammer). The last meeting I was at, I heard everybody use a term I made up a year ago. They called certain code "flows". Honestly, I don't think anybody ever does that with code, I just said at the time for bullshit's sake, to dumb down this chaotic Denny's GrandSlam of a financial fuckup. But the term works for them, and it's fast, and it gets people to where they need to be, understanding.<br />
<br />
I got an offer at another company for double what I was making at &a$%# / cogs today. With a 10 thousand dollar signing bonus to boot, in cold hard cash (at least, thats the offer. gonna keep prepping for interviews after i finish typing this sentence. promise.).<br />
<br />
One company even offered me stock options! They really tried to sell it to. Ahhh, the corporate world. Stocks are still based primarily off how company's are percieved, and how shit goes down between the 10,000 monkeys involved, right? So these companies are offering me a lifetime guarantee of my finances being permanently tied to 10,000 monkeys, doing as they please in an ever changing world? Very cool! Hard pass for now. Too much fucking data and too much fucking bullshit, don't even get me started...<br />
<br />
I proposed to the love of my life in december, her birthday, across the world in australia, with some of my pennies (still paying off that rock baby). I think time's are changing, and there have been so many people who've been in situations like me, that they've made some good companies out there now! I'm now surfing through Job offers, potential money more than I ever dreamed.<br />
<br />
Did you know a software architect makes 800 thousand dollars a year? Neither did i. Damn... they coulda fired one of those monkeys instead of firing 16 of me...<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try to be one of those by the time I turn 28, a rich code monkey, or something like that. Then I'll come give y'all a big party.<br />
<br />
Much love, talk soon ❤️`

But when I dream of the future, I dream of more. More to lose. So we need security. Encryption, everywhere, all of the time. Do we have that already or nah?<br /><br />
I always get encryption and compression mixed up, they seem so similar, but yet so far away?<br />
<br />
We should connect the dots.`
