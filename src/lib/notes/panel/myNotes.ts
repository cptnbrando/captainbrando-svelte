Today, Michael Burry has shorted the US economy yet again, this time betting against the Stock Market itself.
Please watch The Big Short for context, as things are going to get really weird and really sad really fast now.
<br />
<br />
Back in 2005, Michael, a man in charge of a hedgd fund's millions of dollars, looked at all the data regarding house mortgages and loans, and decided that so many people were about to default on their house loans that many giant corporations would have to file for bankruptcy, because the people with these mortgages were all getting fired, and they would be unable to pay for their houses, crashing the economy brick by brick by brick until it folds.
<br />
<br />
Today, after profiting from his predictions in 2005, he has now shorted the stock market. He's now got 1.8 billion, and 90% of this, 1.6 billion dollars he has placed as PUTs on $SPY, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and $QQQ, a group of NASDAQ 100 companies. So, we should all be very scared about the reality the world is in.
<br />
<br />
According to my research, AI General Automation will be complete by 2027. 4 years. This means that soon, the AI robots we have built will be capable of doing most jobs on the planet. Truck drivers, cashiers, secretaries, recruiters, software coders, even more complex jobs like Data Analysts, Sound Engineers, TV/Film Writers, I mean think of it this way; Does your job require any critical thinking, or does it just require a set of instructions that you repeat for every customer/ticket/client/caller/person ? Now, AI is even capable of very good critical thinking too, even creating very entertaining fiction/music/art. And they're free to operate. If i was a business manager, Id replace everybody in my organization with these robots immediately, because labor costs, supporting human beans, it costs so much. By cutting this out, I can double, or even triple my profit. Plus, I dont have to argue with anybody anymore. Thats very, very appealing, to anybody in charge of anything.
<br />
<br />
Very soon, hiring kids out of college, even MIT or Harvard grads, will be more risky than using a robot. Hiring experienced workers, who require 6 figure salaries to afford their houses, this will be too unnecessarily unaffordable. On top of this, their houses require multiple incomes. If a husband and wife have fulltime jobs, and suddenly one gets fired, and there's literally nothing for them to do that a robot cant do faster and more reliably, what choice will that family have except to default on their mortgage? What can a human do to make money if their competition is a free worker that does their job faster, and better? Answer: there is nothing they can do. So they cant make money, and the world will expect them to rot away.

"Theyre all getting screwed you know. You know what they care about? They care about the ball game" - The Big Short, 2015
<br />
<br />
Nobody can do anything anyways now. Because our congress and house of reps and everybody at the top of the government, they're too old to comprehend what an AI is. They don't know this stuff is even possible, all the while their jobs are secure, whether they let the people down or not they'll still get paid until they die. Thats America. Thats why we're all very, very screwed.
<br />
<br />
Today, I am staying in bed, watching The Big Short. They all laughed at Michael Burry when he went in and requested PUTs on the housing market, something advertised and taught in all schools/news media as rock solid. These corporations with millions of employees, they all laughed for years, and then even when they were losing profits and money, they didn't report it, so to the media and the American people, everything was fine and gas was 7 dollars a gallon because the president is just a looney tune. Lies. It was old people, cheating, so they wouldnt lose their game. Gas stayed at 7 dollars a gallon nationwide for years, because old people fired so many employees that the nation's economy shit the bed. It's happening again, right now (over the course of the next 4 years). Its been that way in California since 2020, gas is outrageous over there and nothings changing that.
<br />
<br />
If youve got a house, and its paid off, youre good. If its not yours yet, and you have a mortgage or a loan with a small local bank, be very afraid. They will be the first to declare bankruptcy, and when you try to withdraw your money from a company that has declared bankruptcy, they will laugh at you. That money is gone. Ah, good thing you got insurance on the money! Oh wait, the insurance companies have all declared bankruptcy too... Shit. Now, if everybody pulls out their money from the bank right now, this collapse will happen today itself. So you shouldnt do that. Nobody should withdraw all their money from all their assets immediately and store the cold hard cash under their mattresses. Nobody should panic. At the end of the big short, the government bailed out all these bankrupt corporations. Then, instead of fixing this shit system, they added more risky housing assets to their collection. More stuff that will fall like dominos, very soon.
<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck, god bless us all. Have we learned nothing? Are we still living in a terribly corrupt unreliable system? Do you need multiple incomes to pay for a loan or a rent? Remember these questions, and when the walls collapse, remember this book. Dont start anarchy. Dont do anything rash. Everything is fine. We're all fine and everything is fine.
<br />
<br />
Jobs AI will replace by 2030: Medical workers that aren't surgery operators or physical doctors, Lawyer workers that aren't in court speaking their truth, entire fast food restaurant personnel, mechanical engineers, designers, developers, everybody. By 2040, everybody else. By 2050, god, there'll be nothing to do.

There's so much to life, to live for today. I've never had so much to lose, and it makes me afraid every day.<br />

But when I dream of the future, I dream of more. More to lose. So we need security. Encryption, everywhere, all of the time. Do we have that already or nah?<br /><br />
I always get encryption and compression mixed up, they seem so similar, but yet so far away?<br />

// Here's some pings from twitter, and periscope, their now 'defunct' live recording/streaming platform. ive uninstalled twitter, but the proxsee.pscp.tv pings and the probe.twitter.com pings keep coming in. I definately never installed periscope, because a platform that makes its life off of hidden cameras and other spy bullshit is such a crazy idea!<br /><br /> That probe one, specifically even pinged every time I typed a letter for any tweet, or any text I sent, anywhere on my mobile device. Spyware is amazing, corporate world spyware is fucking stupid. And I am also stupid, so I stay very honest with people I believe to be my friends. Honest, and blunt. So they have all my dirty laundry, whoever they are. My porn habits, my contacts, my bookmarks, my code, my life, my happiness, my soul, my vibes. Evil people! Stay away monkeys!<br /><br /><img src='/img/periscope.png' id='periscope' />

// attempt to get my silence through blackmail, extortion, unlawful recording (audio/visual), unlawful vandalism, trespassing, terror, guilt tripping, logging, spyware, etc. etc...<br /><br /> Money, and just a couple smart people, can make all of this happen in plain sight, overnight, right outside your window. <a href='https://blokada.org/#download'>Get Blokada 5, to monitor and block any incoming network traffic you decide to be bullshit. Remember kids, any pings you see on this app may or may not be sending text, voice, video, gps, accelerometer, and anything else that a phone can do, to wherever it lists (tho it doesnt say what app makes each ping, which is very lame). Sometimes, amazingly, even if any app, on ios or android, is completely asleep or securly locked off. Privacy has never existed, but thank god for this magnifying glass :)</a><br /><br />I now understand why the world sucks so much. Because people are so scared of losing what they have, that it is a very lucrative business to make a job out of taking what others have. Internet tracking technology, along with hard labor by very skilled tracking monkeys, has surpassed even my wildest dreams, and it is very true that if you make enough noise, eventually, everything you do for the rest of your life will be tracked and recorded, and criticized, judged, tarnished, plagiarized, and degraded. Just because they need a fault to exist other than what you claim, there has to be something wrong with you instead of your claims.<br /><br /> Money will forever be louder than any soul's claims, for now.<br /><br />
// So fun to live in a world that screws you, robs you of your will to live, over and over, for thousands of hours, then begs you to build its infrastructure for [dimes, nickles, pennies, an average wage of 50k, with most people in any tech company you join making over 150k, as evidenced by their literal fucking houses.], because old Corporate World people are prideful, and love slavery. Thats what this is, innit? Slavery? Again? Classic.<br /><br />Kindly observe the following items, specifically, proxsee.pscp.tv . PSCP, or PeriscopeTV, is a defunct video/audio streaming site. Motto: Explore the world through the eyes of someone else. If I try to visit https://pscp.tv , I get a message saying its been shut down. This streaming site was owned by Twitter, whom's app has also been relentlessly pinging me, sometimes, on every character I type on my keyboard. I've never once owned a periscope app, and if it's defunct, the Twitter app would not be pinging it. So, how is this in my blokada? Have I been hacked? Omg, so scared, mommy please come help, a fucking loser, a rat, a man who should kill themselves for the sake of this planet, is hacking me. And making me question too much bullshit, because that's they're entire life, building bullshit, one brick at a time.<br /><br /><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcruzships/dcruz-assets/master/images/periscope.png' /><br /><br />...would you believe me if I claimed it was probably multiple people, due to the number of things ive seen/heard? Hmmm.... amazing.
// <br /><br />To be clear, the pings in that image shouldnt scare you too much, usually. All of those Twitter API pings, to the different servers with different numbers, thats actually good. If there was just one ping to one Twitter server, Twitter would be incredibly slow. Thats why they have a hundred servers, differentiated by numbers, because when a million people use it at once, they each need a place to go, and a webserver can only handle so many simultaneous processes (apache tomcat servers can barely handle like 200-1,000 concurrent connections... barely, sorta, depending on how complicated the monkeys made it lol). Tbh, webservers were not really designed with a million similtaneous users in mind, they are designed with tasks in mind, what do we need it to do? Not how many people need it to do things at once. Thats why all companies spend lots of money on getting as many servers as they can get, and they make software that conducts the logic between it all (like kubernetes, kinda).<br /><br />So, yeah... However, why is Periscope there? There is no reason for a defunct video audio streaming service to be pinging on my phone so regularly. Hell, it shouldnt show up at all, because it is literally not in service anymore. So, why is it there? Hmmm... scary. ok bye :)

<br />
Since getting back to America, my company was on fire. They signed deals with [car company], [ticket company], [basketball company], and so many other big companies. They specialized in 401ks, death certificates, loan repayments. Lots of fucking bullshit (data analytical perspective). And I was partnered with the guy in charge of a highway of data, a microservice architecture, Angular (js framework that specializes in generating massive amounts of fucking files for basic tasks to ensure that when 74 monkeys work on an Angular project, 1 monkey can't fuck it all up by themselves, usually).<br />
<br />
Big name companies lately have a lot of information to give, and a lot of money. Millions of dollars in one plan, billions of dollars in another plan (plans btw were like sets of companies, or just one company, either way, usually contain data for thousands of human beans, each labeled everywhere by their SSN, like prison numbers :), each day hundreds of business people writing spreadsheets and numbers (salaries, startDate, endDate, bullShit, bigShit, littleShit, fuckedShit, SSN, birthday, address, number, SSN again because devs love data, etc.). People pay credit cards through their phones now, and they need it reflected in their world instantly. Things are very, very fast. And data, just text, just words, like this story you are reading, is really fucking big.<br />
<br />
For 2 years I worked through Cogz, a contracting company, for Shabadoya Gargantual, a money company. I had a 3 month contract, then another 3 month contract, then a 6 month contract, then another 6, then another 6. Voya Financial paid every contract, because my code was one of the only things somehow not making things load with the massive fucking data moving through it. My day started at 8am, and ended at 5pm, unless the offshore team needed something, in which case I'd have to be on at 7am. 7am - 5pm, is 10 hours. I reported 9 on my timesheets, and so grand total of time playing a bullshit game is... year and a half... 72 weeks... 3240 hours... not counting the fucking Saturday and Sunday night shifts, or those beautiful days on holidays when something is broken or a death certificate got misfiled because it went through a garbage system.<br />
<br />
One night I woke up at 3am to a text from a man I'd never met, saying he just updated the hours fix code. I made the hours fix code, and I was damn sure it was solid, because everything I've ever done for the company, it never failed. Not once. So I got online in my underwear, exhausted, to find that his fix did nothing related to my fix. He lied, worse off, other people believed it was my fault, because of a stupid man who's name I forget. Honestly, it's so complicated I don't even know what happened with it, but tests using a reverted commit with just my bullshit show it working just fine.<br />
<br />
I had a meeting the following morning with the man's team, a bunch of Indians from overseas, along with my team, 2 white guys but mostly also just a bunch of Indians from overseas (not being rude or crass, just honest, Indians like myself make fantastic code monkeys, because many can barely speak english, and are too afraid to stand up for themselves out of fear of losing their livelihood, like me). <br />
<br />
I showed him his code, I showed him their relentless updates, I showed them a massive, massive potential problem, possibly responsible for Shabadoya Gargantual having to pay millions of dollars due to the problem existing for years. And then they laughed in my face, and disconnected to hop to another meeting. My own team included, friends that I depended on frequestly. People that i liked, genuinely. Idk if i like them anymore.<br />
<br />
I kept digging, and I kept finding more and more bullshit. Actually no, I found something worse. Horseshit. Giant horseshit, everywhere. Code, shit. People, shit. Friends, cowards. Questions, everybody say "we don't know".<br />
<br />
I kept my shit remarks to myself, kept it professional, but the shit kept escalating, and the panic continuously increased company wide, with no end in sight. Nobody talking about multithreading or infrastructure or load generators or load balancers. I thought trying to stop a site that's literally bleeding thousands every day would be helpful, no matter what I said. Evidently, that's not how the corporate world works. Instead of problem solving, and innovaton, there are Endless Days, 20 half hour meetings every day for months, everybody burnt out, everybody confused, and the tickets coming to my team were only getting incredibly (laughably) fucking worse. Thousands of incident tickets, millions of dollars, thousands of human beans not getting paid on time. Hundreds of managers entering in their data one-at-a-time, using a garbage incredibly slow piece of hot flaming ass flaps, a website, a system that loads whenever you click anything. <br />
<br />
I wrote a big report, detailing the potential problem and how the issue is probably why hundreds of tickets were opened and remained incomplete, even more that were closed with bullshit answers, sometimes even blaming completely innocent slaves OOPs I meant hundreds of co-working developers getting paid 45k a year, most working from overseas, remote desktop, doing everything their told. Working weekends, days, months, nights, weeks. Time moves strange sometimes, tunnel vision and shit. <br />
<br />
Despite the bullshit, business was booming incredibly well. What really happened behind the scenes is that the people in charge decided to hire the cheapest devs they could find, college grads, to make code. They actually cheaped out on everything, specifically, the giant water tank holding all of the data. Secretly, unbenownst to the 500 slaves OOPs I meant developers engaged in this project, the tank was fucking exploding. No one was smart enough, or educated enough, to even understand how or why it was exploding, they could barely see it. The idea of a system being used simultaneously is still a new concept for old people, and writing code capable of being used by hundreds of things simultaneously is not something the world talks about. The world just talks abput code. They asked me how i knew, if i googled it. I told them "No, ive seen this issue before, because i make a lot of mistakes, and i learn very quickly that way" I genuinely never googled a thing, I just know garbage when i see it, like web data calls to a database in for loops so that a file with 1500 records will try to ping a webserver 1500 times simultaneously. Or an environment variable labeled TWENTY-SECOND-DELAY=20000, and is used in a synchronous thread blocking spring annotation that ensures any transaction will always create a thread on a server that lasts for a minimum of 20 seconds. It always smells really bad, from miles away.<br />
<br />
A COBOL charged Masterfile, a text file, cannot be written to simultaneously. When a write request comes in, it locks the masterfile, stopping others from reading or writing to it until it's free. When thousands of things go to it at once, it spikes. You connected a microservice architecture to a toilet, a textfile. Then put it in prod, and lost millions.<br />
<br />
I sent that report, and the group chats everywhere died the following day. I was right.<br />
<br />
Business understood my vernacular. I dumbed it down, as the business manager had requested me to.<br />
<br />
I kept getting things right. Since the fire had relaxed with business now knowing their data input cannot overlap until that shit gets proper fixed, it was quiet for a weekend. Then a week, or two. My notes went all the way to the architects of the app suite, the big wigs, the head honchos, the scumbag motherfuckers at the top of this rickety corporate ladder. And they all realized I was completely (mostly) right.<br />
<br />
But that meant that they had all been wrong, for 4 years. Not just the 2 I had been there for. That means for 4 years, they lost millions, maybe billions, not including the salaries for 500 developers who couldnt solve it. And I told them how to stop doing that. Gave them a design doc for a new app to fix their shitshow.<br />
<br />
A new guy showed up to work the next day. His name is Patrick. His hair is red. The only thing I heard him say was "uhhhh... Ummm.. I don't know".<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then they fired me. Let me go. Replaced me with a ginger.<br />
<br />
Edit 7/19 - Patrick's actually mad chill and it was a pleasure to assist him to set up his dev environments. He seemed so lost, mentioning co-worker names whom always kept me lost too. He's got a lot to learn, more than me, but I'm glad I could set him up while I could. Maybe he'll figure out a faster way to create reliable code changes than me. I didn't bullshit him, I told him the truths I have learned about this position, and I hope he finds a way to enjoy it sooner than I did.<br />
<br />
I cried about this for a while, but I worked (fun to go to a meeting labeled as "one-on-one catchup" while coding on a quick change code fix, only to get blindsided with a ban hammer). The last meeting I was at, I heard everybody use a term I made up a year ago. They called certain code "flows". Honestly, I don't think anybody ever does that with code, I just said at the time for bullshit's sake, to dumb down this chaotic Denny's GrandSlam of a Financial Fuckup. But the term works for them, and it's fast, and it gets people to where they need to be, understanding.<br />
<br />
I got an offer at another company for double what I was making at Shabadoya Gargantual / Cogs Slow Ass Website ToiletEnthusiasts today. With a 10 thousand dollar signing bonus to boot, in cold hard cash (at least, thats the offer. gonna keep prepping for interviews after i finish typing this sentence. promise.).<br />
<br />
I proposed to the love of my life in december, her birthday, across the world in australia, with some of my pennies (still paying off that rock baby). I think time's are changing, and there have been so many people who've been in situations like me, that they've made some good companies out there now! I'm now surfing through Job offers, potential money more than I ever dreamed.<br />
<br />
EDIT 7/26: nvm they bailed on me, no feedback, just another "pass". junk email. so now, to pay my bills and feed the ones i love, i must either stay with the worst company ive ever done slave labor for, or pray that any of my applications anywhere else yield liveable fruit. so far, nada. just rejection, silence, and bad advice from people with houses, hypocrites telling me to do things theyve never done themselves. This game sucks, and before i die, i vow to destroy it. no more contracts, no more unpaid overtime, no more micromanagers, no more recruiters, no more suffering, no more slavery. Im going to create that world, a fair one, one day at a time.<br /><br />
Did you know a software architect makes 800 thousand dollars a year? Neither did i. Damn... they coulda fired one of those monkeys instead of firing 16 of me...<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try to be one of those by the time I turn 28, a rich code monkey, or something like that. Then I'll come give y'all a big party.<br />

Back in college, I created a creative media webapp called 'if a tree falls on u'. It was very simple, only using html/css/JavaScript and PHP, total code line count less than 500. I didn't know much about web development at the time, I didn't even know node.js and npm packages existed. I was just having fun with code.<br /><br />
Loading the webapp presented the user with two textboxes: one for an email address, and one for a phone number. Both were required to launch the app. Much like this Books section, the app presented many squares filled with images or GIFs. Each square represented a different topic of my life; family, friends, love, hate, an origin story as an interactive comic book.<br /><br />
Clicking on any square opened a new story, or sometimes, a new experience. One square caused the browser to open 50 new tabs of porn. Another square opened a google maps street view link of my hometown playground, pointing at my favorite tire swing. But along with these typical website links was something I now regret making. Using PHP, I discovered it was incredibly easy to send emails and text messages. Even scarier, the code I wrote sent emails and texts from any email address or phone number I wanted. Users would recieve spoof emails, poetry or more, from legitimate domains. message-noreply@linkedin.com , noreply-travel@google.com , real active addresses, completely spoofed and untraceable as the domains of the emails pointed 100% only to those legitimate company domains. When opening the email in google mail or outlook or anything, any email app autopopulates the logo image, contact details, and everything, even linking to previous legitimate emails if you were to have recieved some in the past. My webapp only sent obviously fake messages and media, bad poetry, but now I see that this code is capable of so much more. My 19 year old self created the ultimate phishing machine, and using older versions of PHP that are currently available online, this machine can still be run today. If engineered properly, with strong attention to detail, my creation is capable of fooling the globe, right before their eyes.<br /><br />
Imagine you recieve an ordinary notification email from YouTube, informing you a new Dunkey video was posted. The email sender would show only the legit YouTube email address, but the body can be anything, including a copy/paste of a real notification email, but with the hyperlinks pointing to anything, like YouTube urls that aren't actually YouTube urls but look very similar to real YouTube urls. With companies using email domains that are already scary (contact@email.paramountplus.com , drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com , no-reply@alerts.wellsfargo.com), well, what I'm trying to say is that we're all incredibly fucked. Emails, text messages, phone calls, there's no way to verify that they were sent by the correct parties. I don't think there ever has been. Maybe with PGP signature verifications... but most people don't know what that is, so manipulating these verifications is very easy<br /><br />
Today I reported an email as a phishing scam, and just now recieved an email informing me it is a legitimate email. Even this notification email, I cannot trust it, because as I've just told you, it could have come from anybody or anything that knows my email address. Or, even more crazily, the people in charge of detecting and analyzing phishing scams at my company are unaware that this technology has existed for decades, and it has fooled them just like it almost fooled me. Or it's a legitimate email. But who's to say? What is the truth anymore?<br /><br />
We are living in an untrustworthy world. Even 2 factor authentication can be easily intercepted and bypassed. Web3, a blockchain internet without privacy policy notices, this is even scarier, as nobody can administrate or rule this type of internet; trust must be earned, not given, and web3 asks everybody to simply trust the internet. If you've read this far, then please, stop trusting the internet, no matter what version they are on.<br /><br />
I created that untraceable spam machine at 19, just imagine what people at age 35 can do, with just this knowledge. With npm packages, with websockets, with microservice architectures, with a world of monkeys trying their best to please bosses who aren't aware of the state of the world, because they like the world they built. I like the world they built too, but I now see that there's a lot of bugs in it.<br /><br />
We need to do something better. Something better than email, than texts, than 2fa, than data... yall got any ideas? I aint met a soul who does yet...`;

Have you ever forgotten your password, and had to reset it, only to forget it again the next day? Have you ever clicked 'Allow All Cookies' on a site, without reading the gigantic Privacy Policy? Have you ever created a new account, because for whatever reason, you cannot use the old account anymore? Do you like solving Captchas?

<br />
<br />

Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, have you ever looked at your database (SQL, NoSQL, AWS S3 / RDS, Hadoop Clusters, etc.), and thought "I wish this could be simpler." ? Does it cost 200 million+ to store your data on a Cloud Infrastructure? Will your database / server prices increase next year, perhaps even double or triple?

<br />
<br />

The reality is that people are plentiful now, and each of us has a lot to say/quote/record. The idea of "Scalability" is good as money can keep things going no matter how big the data becomes, increasing server power, increasing operational costs. However, with the rise of AI/bots/spam, it's going up in flames as you speak. Human identity for a social media account is a game of smoke and mirrors, 2 Factor Authentication means I can't use a computer without a phone or code gen dongle. API pricing is rising like Australian waves, and it will keep rising indefinitely. Cloud based _AAS ([Platform, Software, etc.] As A Service) has made things wonderfully fast, at the cost of lots, and lots of money.

<br />

Thankfully, the kids have come up with a solution: Web 3.0

<br />
<br />

Two months ago, I thought 3.0 was nothing, a bunch of hullabaloo without any new benefits. But today, I truly believe it's the key to a better future. Let me explain.

<br />
<br />

2.0 is what the world is now, servers. Lots of servers, all around the world, hosting all videos images texts everything. Compressed, encrypted, cool. 2.0 means a person has to record their video, then upload it to your server, then you'll compress it, and keep it forever. Now, the user still has their original copy of the video. So, what if everybody could just view that original file, directly?

<br />
<br />

That'd mean y'all wouldn't have to spend millions, billions on housing and securing that content, right?

<br />
<br />

Bingo. That's Web 3.0.

<br />
<br />

Forget NFTs, forget crypto, for a second forget everything but the internet: a place for people to read, write, post, create, and share. These web servers / databases of 2.0 hold everything, from the layouts of sites to the content, even though the creators have them on their machines. So, why not just let the users view those original files? Do you want to keep spending that money on servers? Your algorithms can still work on Web 3.0, but now you're not holding the cards, you're just doing what you've been doing, managing and handling content according to how you want and presenting it according to your aggregation algorithms. It's awesome! And now, Web 3.0 means you can just focus on the awesome now! Content curation, instead of content storage / security / authorization / big data.

<br />
<br />

"But Captain Brando! This sounds very sketchy and unsecure, how can 3.0 be secure?" - my good friend circa 2023

<br />
<br />

That's the thing my good friend, it already is! 3.0 begins with a user's crypto wallet, aka, a giant humongous rsh256 encrypted passkey. Now, if anybody reads this passkey, even the user themselves, it is rendered null and void until the user regenerates it. If anybody tries to imitate this key, they cannot validate their guesses, as the Web 3.0 network will know the source of the key is different from the actual location of the key. If brute force, or any tomfoolery is detected on the network, Web 3.0 shuts those fraudulant connections down, blocking them from validating their forgery against anything. If the key is opened, it immediatly lifts up a white flag on the file itself, just like a letter with a confetti string under the seal.

<br />
<br />

If a hacker cannot validate their key, they can't hack the system. Suddenly, even an army of giant quantum computers are rendered obsolete, as they cannot validate their guesses without being disconnected. That's Web 3.0, encryption barricading everything, and trust in the devices themselves.

<br />

When you go to Facebook, Amazon, everything, the first thing you do on a new PC is log in. Now imagine if every one of these sites is connected to your Web 3.0 wallet- aka the giant humongous private unreadable passkey and the user's public wallet address (another random string of data).

<br />
<br />

Bing bang, no more log in pages. Because the device, which can only house one crypto wallet account, is guaranteed to be the person on your site (or at least, can be linked to one single device / owner, so long as any created accounts on the device hard-link back to the wallet).

<br />
<br />

Now there's trust. Web 3.0 means that all creators are easily identifiable from the company's perspective (not the connected nodes perspective mind you, just the underlying system, the blockchain).

<br />
<br />

Without sign-in pages, there's just immediate content access, because the system now knows exactly who you are for any/all of your accounts across the web. If done right, devices can have their private encrypted passkey buried way deep under the hood, inaccesible by all, guaranteeing safety and security. All of a sudden, truth. Web 3.0 guarantees identity; no more untraceable bots or spam, because the system, the network, knows exactly who you are or who created your bot account, regardless of what you choose to call yourself. Nothing but the public wallet address is visible, and under the hood, sites use authenticated global verification to ensure your device has your passkey, your DNA, your truth, your identity. Nobody else except those who never cache, store, or copy this key. No storage of keys, anywhere. Just authentication, then continuing to your internet.

<br />
<br />

That's Web 3.0, a world without log in pages.

<br />
<br />

"Captain, this sounds too good to be true!" Yes friend, you're right. Right now, Web 3.0 needs help. It can be done right, and this world, this internet, can be owned by the people. An open internet without all the annoying spam, it can all be ours, the people, the users! If done right, it can be so secure that even voting can be done right from home, because it's all based on an airtight ledger, an immutable record of events, where if one node has a different copy than a forged node, the fake one cannot connect to it. These nodes can be connected to government IDs, but they don't have to be (they should be tho). It's crazy! But possible!

<br />
<br />

Ok, to justify this crazy talk, we gotta talk about blockchain now. Stay with me! I'll dumb it down.

<br />
<br />

Imagine every cell phone in America. These can act as the nodes of a blockchain, which is a grid of these nodes. Nodes can connect directly to other nodes, no middle server just node to node. Instead of downloading a post from Instagram's web of servers / databases, we would download/stream the post directly from the poster's device. Currently, this would require a sort of leapfrog-esque network traffic, however, I believe this can be streamlined either with better algorithms or with satelites in space. Data centers in the stars, connected to satelites in the stars, raining down site styling / javascript / markup language to cell phone nodes. The device then goes through the blockchain nodes, and retrieves specific content according to site algorithms, right from the poster's devices. Even if the same 2.0 servers were used just to transmit site styling / js / templating data, the ones currently scattered around the globe, you could throw away your databases and pocket that money. Hundreds of millions of infinitely scaling money growing year after year after year, now back in your pockets.

<br />
<br />

Let's visualize this:

<br />
<br />

Barry is a guy with a phone, and he tweets out a good tweet, the best tweet ever. Sandra follows Barry, and she's scrolling along, and the beautiful Twitter algorithm is showing her good stuff, making her laugh. Pause time here for a second. At the bottom of the page is a new tweet, the algorithm wants to show Barry's cool new content (along with more paginated content of course!). So, Sandra's web 3.0 phone goes and gets it, but not directly as Sandra's in Uganda and Barry's in New Orleans. Sandras phone is connected to her friend Tammy, who's in Chad. Tammy is connected to a satellite, up in space, that holds all of the site data for Facebook Amazon Google etc. Thanks to Tammy, Sandra's tweets look nice, but she still doesn't have Barry's tweet. For that, her device will keep traveling through the chain. Sandra to Tammy, Tammy to Henry, Henry to Frank, Frank to Barry... this is slow! 2.0 is cool because it's just one set of servers, one fragmented database, coagulated together. But if you think about it, ain't that the same thing? In 3.0, Sandra makes about 6 requests to get Barry's content. In 2.0, Sandra actually makes way more, as the databases are fragmented for the sake of housing the giant warehouse of tweets, and the application needs to GET data all day so it can be fast. 3.0 can still get data all day, but now, it's just connecting to other encrypted devices, saving companies an immense amount of bandwidth.

<br />
<br />

Seriously, this is possible now. And frankly, it was a crazy idea to copy everybody's content away from their devices, just to store it in Antarctica, in a bunch of computer farms, when the creators have the content on their devices already!

<br />
<br />

In 3.0, the power goes back to the people. Blockchains are, by definition, uneditable. Any edits require more additions, so with any transaction it's easy to see who did it, tracked by their randomly generated passkey and public wallet address (This is similar to IP address, which can be used to track a user's location. Now, a user's location is not hidden, proving they are real. This may sound scary, but it's the only way to eliminate spam / junk mail / phishing schemes / everything that can violate a user's internet experience). For voting procedures, the locations can easily be tracked too, so if 500 votes all of a sudden come from an apartment in Tokyo, we can call them up and see what the truth is, because we'll know where the apartment is and who lives there. We'll know their history of internet activity. It's like how a webserver logs user interactions, except now, it's baked right into the network. No more Log4J, printing/zipping text files, it's all visible right there, providing security and trust to all.

<br />
<br />

NFTs, Crypto, there's a lot the kids want in this network. And it deserves to be there too! But the world deserves to use it too, and if done properly by a good community, Web 3.0 can change everything. But, right now, it's just an idea.

<br />
<br />

This is why this needs to be done right. We need innovation in new tech, new algorithms, new wifi, new ideas to cook this delicious Web 3.0 stew! I am in favor of a new device that can only access Web 3.0, linking one single new wallet immediately to the blockchain and the device, so that the user doesn't have to remember a password ever again. This device does not need WiFi if we can engineer a way to connect directly to another device, that's how we can make this Web 3.0 fast! WiFi, 5G, web servers, it adds unnecessary traffic to a simple concept- User to User connection. If done right, no more pass managers, no more sign in pages, no more wasted time, because the truth is baked into the OS, and an immutable ledger of events is uncrackable / automatically maintains and manages itself. AI is a major part of this system, and if done right, so many things can be automated just by asking it to do so.

<br />
<br />

"Hey Web3! Make me a blog website and add an article titled "Cats!". Use my Google Keep note for the body, and add some nice pictures of cats. Host it on my node, and add it to my Web3 portfolio card, please!"

<br />
<br />

AI: "Done deal, your blog is now live. Visit it here: [cat blog site, not a url, just a simple name like 'BrandosCatBlog']."

<br />
<br />

Seriously, it can be that easy for creators of any size to produce content for Web 3.0. If the device syncs with all social media platforms, the AI can post it there too, on all of them simultaneously as soon as it's created!

<br />
<br />

"Captain Brando, this sounds way too powerful of a pipe dream, and the people will flood the internet with dumb articles about Cats." Exactly! They're already flooding Web 2.0 right now! Even worse, content is easily downloaded and copied to other accounts/platforms, giving the copier revenue while the original artist makes nothing. Web 3.0 ensures content cannot be stolen, or rather, it gives people an easier way to share their favorite posts, all linking to the same file from the original artist on their original device. We know who's the original artist, because of a consistent ledger, a global log of events (even better, this log isn't just text. We can search the log with an input video file, and it will show the original owner).

<br />
<br />

This 3.0 internet is the future! No more emails (perhaps a better app/site that aggregates your messages from all of your social medias/texts/calls ?). No more "Sign in With Facebook / Google / LinkedIn / MySpace." No more captchas (even if you build and use a web bot, as their identity is linked to yours, so the world can trust your creations). No more refactoring code (unless you mess up the initial conversion to web3, in which case an AI can fix it for you at the push of a button, or you can fix the code yourself if you're a cool human bean). No more AWS bills that endlessly increase as you get more popular. No more linking all your financial / personal videos / life to a public email address or phone number that's known by everybody. No more giving your credit card number, date, cvc codes to random sellers and marketplaces that you'll never use again, where it'll live indefinitely on their database whether you cancel your subscription or not.

<br />
<br />

Scalibility, Synergy, Fake News, none of it! This doesn't even cover the glorious AI technology conducting everything like Mozart. This article is just the tip of the iceberg. Yes, it's a million, billion, maybe even trillion dollar product. Yes, it's capable of changing the world, freeing us all.

<br />
<br />

Web 3.0 is coming, and you should join the party. It's raining money here, and everybody's a human. The memes are golden, the music is awesome, and we trust you for being yourself. Welcome to the world!
